			<title>Mets report</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;We were seated betw two sets of Cubs fans and they made our lives living hell, until the 7th inning when the Mets caught up and went ahead on some bad fielding by the Cubbies. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ride home on the subway was fun too. No Cubs fans on the train. I suspect they all brought Mets hats with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other news, every game I've been to with Patrick Scoble the Mets have won. No exceptions. And it's not like we've only been to a few games. Eventually the law of averages may well catch up with us. And in the 9th inning it looked like it had, but I channeled a message to Jeurys Famillia saying I really wanted us to win and it worked. He got the last guy to pop out to the infield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also the Cubs should probably have sent the runner in from third but the rookie Nemmo threw a bullet to his cutoff man, and he might well have been out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets! Go! Mets!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>AWS docs, day 2</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I want to try to zoom in on what I need from &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/29/1334.html&quot;&gt;AWS tech docs&lt;/a&gt; that I'm not getting, using as an example a problem I have now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am using Dropbox to manage a few of my servers. I want to know if I can use Elastic File System as a replacement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a folder for each server. And within it a sub-folder for each of the apps I'm running on a server. When I want to update an app, or add some data to it, I edit files in its folder. Pretty quickly they flow up to the server, and if necessary I relaunch the app using the Terminal app on my Mac, and go on. The loop happens in seconds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flow goes the other way. If I want to see how an app is running, I can open their stats files or other data files on my desktop using the Mac Finder, using Dropbox to bridge the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's great until Dropbox stops working. Usually on the server. Then I have to restart the Dropbox daemon and wait a few minutes until it catches up. Sometimes it's a lot more than a few minutes. And once the Dropbox never came back. Re-installing the software doesn't help and rebooting the server doesn't. All magic incantations fail to get Dropbox to do anything useful. That's what I'm dealing with now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I think, since this server happens to be on EC2, wouldn't it be interesting to use EFS to connect it to my desktop. This leads me to read the EFS docs. I need to quickly find out if it does what I want, and then I need &lt;i&gt;quick&lt;/i&gt; instructions to give it a try. I emphasize the need for speed. I'm doing grunt work that wasn't in my plan for the day. I'm rapidly falling behind. I need a way forward that will work. But first I need to know &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; this way forward works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why all extraneous information makes it harder, and nine times out of ten when it's an AWS technology that could possibly save my ass, I don't end up using it, because I can't do the evaluation quickly enough and I find something else sooner and can get my project back on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm still there with Elastic File System. Dropbox has failed on one of my EC2 instances. I either must find a way to hook it up to my EC2 instance and to the Finder on my desktop, or I'll provision a new server and start moving the apps to that server, and stick with Dropbox for another go-around, even though (key point) I don't want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, my questions about EFS are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Is there a way to mount an EFS volume on my Mac desktop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. How can I quickly attach it to an existing Ubuntu server running on EC2.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't care about any options or hugely scalable features. I don't have a VPN. Right now I just need to get to Hello World to see if this is a possible approach for me to use. The next-level stuff will come later.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suspect, btw, that this is fairly normal for developers. Users of my server software have even less attention to give the startup process. If it isn't straight 1-2-3 with no curveballs, the software will never get used. I'm okay with that because I totally understand the mindset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What does Trumpocalypse mean?</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;What if the meaning of the experience with #brexit and Trump is that the civilization we've built doesn't work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty sure that's what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant&quot;&gt;blind men and the elephant&lt;/a&gt;, we're all seeing little pieces of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to a point the rich have been able to insulate ourselves from this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say anyone is to blame. Nor does it mean that the rich can do anything about it. Lots more to say about this, but this is the conclusion I'm reaching, and thought I should share it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: Obviously we should try to figure out what we have to do to make it work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Amazon: Make AWS easier to start with</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm a longtime user/customer of Amazon Web Services, going all the way back to the beginning when they rolled out &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt;, their basic storage system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main site, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/&quot;&gt;scripting.com&lt;/a&gt;, is an S3 bucket. I have an &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/&quot;&gt;EC2&lt;/a&gt; instance that runs a bunch of my apps. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/route53/&quot;&gt;Route 53&lt;/a&gt; to manage domains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I probably would use more of their services, but they're so damned hard to get started with. Which is a shame because once you've climbed the hill, they're not that hard to &lt;i&gt;use.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically I have to approach a product several times,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;often over a period of months, before the clutter gets out of the way, and the steps-to-start reveal themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm dealing with that now with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.aws.amazon.com/efs/home?region=us-east-1#/firstrun&quot;&gt;Elastic File System&lt;/a&gt;. I was allowed early access to it, but when I looked at the docs, I could tell right off that I would have to learn a lot of extra concepts before I could get to Hello World. Usually it takes a few approaches over months before I break through and discover how to use one of these toolkits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They really ought to fix this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They need a different kind of doc-writer, someone who &lt;i&gt;develops&lt;/i&gt; the docs as you would factor a piece of software. Write down the long step-by-step process, and look for ways to eliminate steps. Iterate, test it with real people, and go back and do it again. Find a path that gets it up and running in a single session.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even better if the docs-writing experience could feed back in to the design of the product dashboards, so the defaults could be the easy path into the product., reducing steps in the startup docs. That's how you factor the startup process. Factoring works with docs too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone says we should teach kids to code, what if instead we made it so that the machines they're using didn't need so much coding? Amazon really has something here, the way we should all be doing computing in the future, but now it requires people to know too much to get the simple result most people will want.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: I want to acknowledge that they have started to do stuff like what I describe here, in the Lambda product, and in the release of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/gs-step-one-create-ec2-resources.html&quot;&gt;EFS&lt;/a&gt;. But there are so many concepts they use that I don't understand, in both products, that's why I have to approach and re-approach. Most of their competitors are no better, btw. The walls are higher than they need to be everywhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Where news makers go to make news</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you break down a news story into its components, it's basically&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Quotes from sources strung together to tell a story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data, a number of people killed, a vote on a referendum, a score in a game, percent unemployed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The point of view of the reporter and the editorial team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you look at what's changed in news in the last decade or two, it's mostly in how they get quotes. Reporters used to call sources, or email with them, one-to-one. Now, most of the quotes are public, probably on Twitter.

			<title>Keeping the number of copies down</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time I get reports from users that say they're using some software that prevents the browser from loading script code from other domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know where it's written that thou must only include code from the same domain. I re-use components in my web apps. Each app has its own domain. I don't see why I should have to maintain copies of identical files in different folders to make some weird software happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further wasn't this the basis for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP&quot;&gt;JSONP&lt;/a&gt;? The idea that if you wrap data in script code you can reference it anywhere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not even sure who writes this code, or what the name of the software is. The bug reports from users generally don't include this info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also doesn't happen that often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your humble blogger,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>My ode to Terrapin Station</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I get to the top of the first hill on my daily bike ride, I pull over to the side, and queue up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I7CLy70WtI&quot;&gt;Terrapin Station&lt;/a&gt; on the iPhone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hooked up to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Pill-Portable-Speaker-Black/dp/B00GJVF766/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1467035039&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=beat+pill+speakers&quot;&gt;Beats Pill&lt;/a&gt; that's &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Mount-Portable-Speaker-Black/dp/B00G3SNCGM/ref=pd_sim_23_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;dpID=41AdbCTOZyL&amp;amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;amp;preST=_AC_UL320_SR320%2C320_&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=EQPAP553ZEJ37T7MQKY6&quot;&gt;strapped&lt;/a&gt; onto the handlebar. I don't connect them via Bluetooth, it's too unreliable, instead I have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/iXCC-Tangle-Free-Auxiliary-Connectors-Smartphones/dp/B00KWR8ME2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1467035270&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=cable+mini+jack&quot;&gt;mini-to-mini&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;cable connecting the two. Perfect.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrapin is a beautiful two-part song. For whatever reason I never listened to that &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin_Station&quot;&gt;album&lt;/a&gt; so it's still new to me. A new, great Grateful Dead song is such a rarity, for me. And it's the perfect song to ride to. Long strides. A memorable melody. Haunting &lt;a href=&quot;http://artsites.ucsc.edu/GDead/agdl/terr.html&quot;&gt;lyrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't play it so loud as to disrupt other riders, or people enjoying the warm summer days in the park. I'm sure in the future I'll have pleasant memories triggered by listening to this song. I'm sure to tire of it eventually, but not yet. I like to listen to it while programming too. And of course I'm listening now, as I write &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/27/1331.html&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS: A terrapin is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin&quot;&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Bergman disagreed. He mocked me. Said I was stupid. I thought hah I will have the last laugh, assuming I live long enough to see the day.

			<title>Walls keep good ideas out, too</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1979, I called the Encyclopedia Brittanica because I thought their product could be computerized. They followed up by sending a salesman, trying to sell me a set of books. He was persistent. I kept trying to explain that my interest was in working with them to create an electronic product. I even did a demo of what a computerized Brittanica would look like. I didn't buy the books and they never really heard my idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This keeps happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/04/16/aNewReasonToHateComcast.html&quot;&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; fired me as a customer because I was using too much bandwidth, but I was developing software that could make use of all that bandwidth. At the same time they paid hundreds of millions for a software company whose products they never used. They couldn't even send someone to talk with me about my usage of the net to find out what I was up to. I wasn't a complete unknown, and the technology I was developing ended up being pretty valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today it's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I like what they've done with their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;news flow&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; are vastly more interesting these days. But I'm not going to pay to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;read it&lt;/a&gt;, today at least. And if I do pay at some point in the future, I'm going to feel sick about it. I already feel sick about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;paywall&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know what its limits are. But when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;click&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; after say the 10th of the month, I get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; saying I must pay to read. So I don't read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn't pass through my linkblogging system. Not a big deal, but it is worth a blog post after a number of months putting up with the frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels the same as the experience with the Encyclopedia Britannica in the late 70s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess the point is this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great idea that helps you grow might not come from a consultant or an off-site or through high-price acquisitions. It's one of the reasons silos aren't great for idea flow. Companies are not set up to receive good ideas from places they aren't expecting them. That's why businesses that bet on having low walls, permeable walls, or no walls keeping out the ideas might do better than those who think the walls create value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope Bezos helps the Washington Post be creative with this. There probably are better ways to make money from news than restricting the flow of links to stories to people who pay to read them. &amp;nbsp;However, I have to say Amazon itself isn't very good at having ideas permeate their corporate wall. Luckily they have a number of good ideas internally, and must be doing something right there. But they could do a lot better with AWS. But that's a topic for another day. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I didn't buy the books and they never really heard my idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This keeps happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/stories/2008/04/16/aNewReasonToHateComcast.html&quot;&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; fired me as a customer because I was using too much bandwidth, but I was developing software that could make use of all that bandwidth. At the same time they paid hundreds of millions for a software company whose products they never used. They couldn't even send someone to talk with me about my usage of the net to find out what I was up to. I wasn't a complete unknown, and the technology I was developing ended up being pretty valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today it's the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I like what they've done with their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;news flow&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; are vastly more interesting these days. But I'm not going to pay to &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;read it&lt;/a&gt;, today at least. And if I do pay at some point in the future, I'm going to feel sick about it. I already feel sick about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;paywall&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know what its limits are. But when I &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;click&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; after say the 10th of the month, I get a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; saying I must pay to read. So I don't read the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/21/wppaywall.png&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn't pass through my linkblogging system. Not a big deal, but it is worth a blog post after a number of months putting up with the frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It feels the same as the experience with the Encyclopedia Britannica in the late 70s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess the point is this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The great idea that helps you grow might not come from a consultant or an off-site or through high-price acquisitions. It's one of the reasons silos aren't great for idea flow. Companies are not set up to receive good ideas from places they aren't expecting them. That's why businesses that bet on having low walls, permeable walls, or no walls keeping out the ideas might do better than those who think the walls create value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope Bezos helps the Washington Post be creative with this. There probably are better ways to make money from news than restricting the flow of links to stories to people who pay to read them. &amp;nbsp;However, I have to say Amazon itself isn't very good at having ideas permeate their corporate wall. Luckily they have a number of good ideas internally, and must be doing something right there. But they could do a lot better with AWS. But that's a topic for another day. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;"  created="Tue, 21 Jun 2016 13:25:17 GMT" />

			<title>NRA nonsense</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just listened to an interview with the NRA chief &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlecardeditor.com/users/davewiner/cards/2016/06/13/wayneLapie284.html&quot;&gt;Wayne LaPierre&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/pages/7532.html&quot;&gt;Face The Nation&lt;/a&gt;. Trump was on before him, talking about how you shouldn't be politically correct, all the while refusing to say anything specific about what he would do to combat the terrorism he says is so rampant. In other words Trump has become politically correct, perfectly so. A real slippery politician. LaPierre says we're about to be overwhelmed by ISIS. Problem is a lot of people listening to him believe that kind of bullshit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another popular bullshit line asks why should we bother passing laws -- since the &quot;bad guys&quot; don't bother with laws anyway. This sounds really savvy until you start to dig in. By that logic we shouldn't outlaw murder either, because murderers don't follow the law, right? But if it weren't illegal, then we wouldn't be able to put someone in jail for murdering someone. Right? And if we make owning automatic weapons illegal, we don't have to wait until we catch you killing 49 people in a night club on a Saturday night. We can arrest you as soon as we see that you have in your possession a gun whose only use is to mow down dozens of people. This would of course prevent some number of murders by automatic weapon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically yes, we should outlaw things like owning guns that can only be used for mass murder. And yes, if we did so, it likely would result in fewer deaths. It certainly would not result in more! How's that for a little common sense, non-politically correct talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaPierre is the worst kind of person. I wish we could outlaw being that kind of person, but this is America and that's a line we won't cross. Though of course his candidate Trump doesn't live by that rule.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>The Central Park of the web</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Evan Williams &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/ev-williams-is-the-forrest-gump-of-the-internet/486899/&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the web is about money now, not creativity. He says this follows the pattern of previous technologies. At first there's a wonderful burst of creativity and then it's locked down by a few big companies. The fun is over. Now it's about money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess that's what you see from his perspective. And from Facebook, Apple and Google, and maybe Oracle and Salesforce, and a few others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are technologies that went a different way.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;My favorite example is Manhattan's relationship to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park&quot;&gt;Central Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The apartment buildings around the park are the money, and the creativity is in the park. The buildings are exclusive, the most expensive real estate in the world. The park is open to anyone, rich or poor, from anywhere in the world.&amp;nbsp;The park is the engine of renewal. It's where the new stuff comes from. The buildings are where the money is parked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the interview Williams did with the Atlantic, in NYC, they looked into the park from a&amp;nbsp;nearby&amp;nbsp;hotel. That's one valid perspective of course. Or you could go for a walk and see what's happening &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; the park.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can see a great concert at Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall, but there's great music in the park too. It's different. But it's good music. And the price is right. ;-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And btw, Amazon is making the opposite bet from Evan's. They offer cheap servers for everyone. I think that's the right bet. But that's my point of view.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter, when they put limits on the use of the API, decided to be an apartment building. A great one for sure. And it makes a lot of money. But there are severe limits on the creativity that comes out of the building. They might have made even more money if they chose to be the Central Park of the web.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What programming is like</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/18/cradle.png&quot;&gt;picture&lt;/a&gt; of a Cat's Cradle.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an arrangement of string that makes something real out of something virtual. It's a complex arrangement. It makes my mind hurt, a little. It requires physical dexterity and practice. It's hard to explain in words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When people say that programming is &quot;coding&quot; it sounds (to me) like turning language into Morse Code. Translate something literate into something transmittable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's really the software machines we create that do the coding. I teach a computer how to encode your writing so that other people can read it on their computers. So I'm creating &lt;i&gt;a machine&lt;/i&gt; that does the coding.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This may be a misunderstanding between us and our users. They don't see the role that human beings play in creating the tools that do the coding. I get this from users all the time, going back to when I was starting programming. The fact that people don't understand doesn't make it any easier however! :-)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>It's all terrorism</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There's a debate going on in the US about what is and isn't terrorism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some think what happened in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Orlando_nightclub_shooting&quot;&gt;Orlando&lt;/a&gt; was terrorism, also in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack&quot;&gt;San Bernardino&lt;/a&gt;, but not in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_church_shooting&quot;&gt;Charleston&lt;/a&gt;, last year at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read in a NYT piece with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/18/us/pulse-nightclub-orlando-mass-shooting.html?smid=tw-nytnational&amp;amp;smtyp=cur&quot;&gt;survivor stories&lt;/a&gt; from Orlando, really horrifying stuff. They mentioned that the Orlando shooter had been studying the Charleston church shooting. It's all part of the same thread. If one is terror, it's all terror. They're learning from each other. Passing on best practices. (The Charleston shooter is still alive. I wonder what he thinks about Orlando.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the Orlando shooter was checking Facebook to see if his posts, from inside the night club, during the attack, were going viral. A sick feeling. It's the same impulse we all have, a desire to be noticed in social media.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a story about how a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nypost.com/2016/06/17/gangbanger-facebook-lives-his-own-murder/&quot;&gt;Chicago gang murder&lt;/a&gt; was broadcast live on Facebook. It wasn't planned that way, but it happened. How long before the next Orlando or the one after that is shown live on Facebook from the insider's perspective, as part of the programming, for the next guy to study, and for all of us to feel ever more helpless. Terror for the masses filtered by Facebook's algorithm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I read another story, this one I don't remember where, that asked why are people buying AR-15's, why is it the most popular product at gun stores. Why? They think we're being invaded by ISIS. Although people say they don't trust news media, they actually believe what they tell them. They fill in the blanks, because that's how human minds work. This is what they talk about with their friends. (You see these people sometimes on Facebook, I always thought they were outliers, but they are not. Over 40 percent of Americans will vote for Trump. Now go listen to what Trump says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I heard this first in an interview with a man who assaulted a protestor at a Trump rally. He said with a straight almost innocent look that the guy he attacked was from ISIS. They've been taught that people who disagree and who have dark skin are from ISIS. This, for many people, is a fact, not in dispute. They want to own assault weapons because they believe they will have to defend their homes soon. One in every room for every member of the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America is jammed to the gills with guns. People are getting ready to use them. What comes next? I guess they use them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It came as a special episode of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thewestwingweekly.com/&quot;&gt;West Wing Weekly&lt;/a&gt; podcast, which continues to be more than excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently watched a whole bunch of West Wings, and stopped with &lt;a href=&quot;http://westwing.wikia.com/wiki/The_Supremes&quot;&gt;S5 E17&lt;/a&gt;, which has what is imho the best line in any West Wing episode. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westwingtranscripts.com/wwscripts/5-17.txt&quot;&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; to his clerk, &quot;Jed Bartlet from New Hampshire had an idea!&quot; It wasn't sarcastic, because he really did have a great idea. And the Chief Justice said it with a New England accent of some sort. It's fun because there are a lot of Supreme Court justices in the show and none of them like Bartlet. We think he's brilliant but they think he's a hack. So finally he gets some respect (thought it really is Josh's idea). This is one of the most optimistic episodes. And it's very nicely acted by the cast and a few special guests.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you love the West Wing, you must &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/traffic.libsyn.com/westwingweekly/0.01_-_West_Wing_Reunion_Live_from_ATX.mp3&quot;&gt;listen&lt;/a&gt; to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcatch.com/pages/7453.html&quot;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt;. It's got some incredible insight into the show. And if you're involved in a podcast of a TV show, have a listen, they're setting a pretty high bar for how to do this relatively new art. It's a &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/10/1312.html&quot;&gt;story-telling&lt;/a&gt; medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: I wrote that about 3/4 the way through the episode. Sometimes these shows get too self-congratulatory. They did go a bit over the top. It must feel nice to heap the praise on but it doesn't make for good listening.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Trump screws the NRA</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have to admit Trump is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/can-donald-trump-move-the-nra-on-guns/487163/?utm_source=atltw&quot;&gt;doing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/743078235408195584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; clever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's going to meet with &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlecardeditor.com/users/davewiner/cards/2016/06/13/wayneLapie284.html&quot;&gt;Wayne LaPierre&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that he get behind an weapon ban for people on terrorist watch lists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's cute because the NRA endorsed him. They pretty much have to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's irreverent. It's the tail wagging the dog. And it's probably going to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know they said &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Nixon_visit_to_China&quot;&gt;Nixon could go to China&lt;/a&gt; because he was a Republican.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone expects a Democrat to be for gun control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a Republican getting behind it is really subversive. Even if it is DJ Trump. And even if it doesn't go nearly far enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason to like it is that while it won't likely get Trump any Democratic votes it sure is going to piss off a lot of Republicans, and expose them for the unthinking heartless NRA puppets that they are. I'm getting my popcorn out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Ending Hack-A-Shaq</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had an idea watching last night's Finals &lt;a href=&quot;http://kron4.com/2016/06/13/draymond-less-warriors-overwhelmed-by-cavs-in-game-5-loss/&quot;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt;, Golden State vs Cleveland. At the end of the third quarter, the Warriors were playing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack-a-Shaq&quot;&gt;Hack-a-Shaq&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cleveland.com/livingston/index.ssf/2016/05/cleveland_cavaliers_tristan_th.html&quot;&gt;Tristan Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, the Cleveland big man who is a bad foul shooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15464738/there-no-clear-answer-how-solve-hack-shaq-issue&quot;&gt;hand-wringing&lt;/a&gt; over the practice, it destroys the flow of the game, but it's legal, and when one team puts a guy on the court who can't shoot free throws, the door is open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyway, the NBA hasn't come up with a rule that would effectively stop it. During the game, feeling the frustration, I wondered why they don't flip it around. After a certain number of fouls committed on a player, the team being fouled can choose a different free throw shooter for the guy being Shaq'd.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would provide a limit on repeated fouling of the bad free-throw shooter. Make the limit 6, the same number of fouls that cause a player to foul out of a game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>We can change the gun laws</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why do we only talk about gun violence in the immediate aftermath of a mass killing?&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;If we want to change the laws in the US we have to develop a longer attention span.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We had a fantastic opportunity to talk about meaningful ways to change the laws in the faceoff between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. It's fairly obvious that at least at one point in his political career Sanders was &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/liveblog/users/davewiner/2016/03/19/1130.html&quot;&gt;backed by&lt;/a&gt; the NRA. His excuse that he represented a rural state while true was nonsense. He was running for President, of all the states, including states where people die from gun violence every day. Clinton didn't want to push it, but that doesn't mean &lt;i&gt;voters&lt;/i&gt; couldn't have made it an issue. We totally could have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We make the mistake of falling for candidates as if they were sports teams, and not insisting that they represent our interests. We think voting for a person is like rooting for the Warriors or Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. Politics is good sport, for sure -- but the political decisions we make, or don't make, can result in 50 people dead on a Saturday night in an Orlando night club. The bullets are real, as is the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will never create the change so many say they want until we can sustain the feeling and carry it through to Election Day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective thing we could do is to organize to end the careers of reps who are &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/14/nra.png&quot;&gt;funded by&lt;/a&gt; the NRA. Make it impossible, at least in some states, for them to take their money. We don't need to win everywhere, just in enough places to pass the laws we need to at least slow the process by which potential mass murderers get weapons of mass murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;There are ways to do this, it's a relatively easy thing to do, it just requires a sustained commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Vote against the NRA in November</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you want to diminish the power of the NRA, there's really only one way you and I can do it, by organizing to replace &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/nra-donations/?tid=sm_tw&quot;&gt;NRA-owned reps&lt;/a&gt; with ones that aren't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best time to organize is just before a major election, which of course is right now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking primarily of Congressional races. There's a pretty clear widely understood choice in the Presidential election this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not about &quot;taking your guns away&quot; -- unless you want to kill dozens of people rapidly. If that's what you want, then I think most people would agree that it's a &lt;i&gt;good thing&lt;/i&gt; to take your gun away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make a difference, look at people who are running for Congress in your area, and see which ones are &lt;a href=&quot;https://votesmart.org/interest-group/446/national-rifle-association-political-victory-fund#.V165IhUrJBw&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; by the NRA and which aren't.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work against the ones the NRA likes, and support the ones the NRA opposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;That means:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Give them money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go to rallies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make phone calls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knock on doors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tell your friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be creative!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is a highly leveraged time to be politically active. In normal times it's hard to get anything to change, but now is a time when change can happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't let the politicians define what change means. Define it for yourself and then put it into action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If that's what you want, then I think most people would agree that it's a &lt;i&gt;good thing&lt;/i&gt; to take your gun away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make a difference, look at people who are running for Congress in your area, and see which ones are &lt;a href=&quot;https://votesmart.org/interest-group/446/national-rifle-association-political-victory-fund#.V165IhUrJBw&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; by the NRA and which aren't.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work against the ones the NRA likes, and support the ones the NRA opposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;That means:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Give them money.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Go to rallies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Make phone calls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Knock on doors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tell your friends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Be creative!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is a highly leveraged time to be politically active. In normal times it's hard to get anything to change, but now is a time when change can happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don't let the politicians define what change means. Define it for yourself and then put it into action.&lt;/p&gt;"  created="Mon, 13 Jun 2016 13:35:13 GMT" />

			<title>What Silicon Valley could do about Gawker/Thiel</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;In today's &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2016/06/10/1313.html&quot;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; I suggest that other Silicon Valley CEOs and VCs could back Gawker in defense of Thiel's legal attack, by buying it out of bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much has been written about why what Thiel did will have a chilling effect on the struggling world of journalism. It effects bloggers too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting the pieces back together later might be impossible. And free expression is something SV depends on, more than it may know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/dave.winer.12/posts/450236198517124&quot;&gt;where&lt;/a&gt; I'm writing this now, to give you an idea. (This is a cross-post of something I wrote on Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far I am able to use Facebook to criticize Facebook, but who knows whether they demote it via the algorithm. I imagine they might have some levers behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more FB and others stand by and do nothing as Gawker is destroyed, the less faith I have in their neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm thinking of a few liberal tech CEOs and VCs who I would like to see step up here. Not going to put their names in this post. But I wanted to put the idea out there.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
